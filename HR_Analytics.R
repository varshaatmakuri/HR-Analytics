# -------------------------------------- 1. Business Understanding ----------------------------------------------------

# XYZ company employs around 4000 employees, at any given point of time. 
# Every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company (either on their own or because they got fired)
# These employees have to be replaced by other talented individuals.

# This level of attrition is bad for the company, because of the following reasons:

# 1) The projects get delayed, difficult to meet timelines, results in reputation loss among consumers and partners.
# 2) A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purpose of recruiting new talent.
# 3) These new employees have to be trained for the job and have to be given time to adjust in the new work enviornment.

# Hence, HR analytics firm has been hired to do the following:

# a) to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition.
# b) to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.
# c) to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.

#Conclusions :

#BusinessTravel: Among the Employees who leave, most travel frequently
#Department: There is more attrition in R&D Department and less attrition for HR department.
#Education: Among people attrited employees from HR department are less. It is because of low proportion of HR in the organization
#Gender: Attrition of Male is high, since 61% of employees in our dataset are Male.
#EducationField: Attrition is less in case of Human Resources and Others and more in life sciences
#EnvironmentSatisfaction: People who are least satisfied with the environment tend to leave.
#JobInvolvement: We see that majority of employees who leave are either Very Highly involved or Low Involved in their Jobs.
#JobSatisfaction: We see higher attrition levels in among lower Job Satisfaction levels.Very few Doctors leave the organisation since their total number is quit less
#IncomeLevel: We see higher levels of attrition among the lower segment of monthly income. 
#MaritalStatus: Attrition rate is more in case of Single and less among divorcees.
#PerformanceRating: We see that we have employees of only 3 and 4 ratings. Lesser proportion of 4 raters quit.
#WorkLifeBalance: if considering the proportion of data, attrition is more in level 1 which is as expected.
#JobRole: More attrition in case of Research Scientists and Sales Executives and less in case of HR
#TenurePerJob: Usually, people who have worked with many companies for small periods tend to leave early.
#Overtime: Larger Proportion of Overtime Employees are quitting.

# For the newly derived metrics, YearsWithoutChange and YearsWithoutChange2,
# We can see with low tenure and low years without change tend to leave the organisation.
